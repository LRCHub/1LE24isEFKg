I try not to let my trinkets
Get the best of me
It's like the times that I once had
Are slipping away
I need a memory
One that ends up happily
Petrified I spiral back again

Your scent still in this room
And I can smell your perfume

Take a deep breath and hold it in
Exhale into the air
Please don't panic
You're almost there
The lock is open
Concentrate unseal

And all I do is lie here and I feel numb
Because by the time I sing this song
I know you'll be gone

Oh no please don't go
