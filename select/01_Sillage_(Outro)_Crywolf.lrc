[00:00.64] You were the answer to my dreams
[00:04.69] Your scent in me so deep
[00:08.38] I want to tell you something
[00:14.38] Dressed in a stunning red
[00:18.88] Your head upon my chest
[00:22.61] The pain inside means nothing
[00:31.93] Take off your shirt and lay down
[00:36.77] Right next to the pile of things we loved when we were younger
[00:43.96] Eyes half closed
[00:46.67] You were the answer that I had
[00:51.21] But you weren't all I wanted
[00:54.74] You weren't all I needed
